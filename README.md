# KNN-on-SUV-Purchases
A fairly simple K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm was run to predict whether a customer would purchase a brand-new SUV from a car dealership or not.

The dataset come from the *Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science* program by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. I made this notebook mostly to show what metrics/methods I would use to validate and test various KNN models.
